I ‚ù§ [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), so I use it for all frontend project I do.

So when "someone" starts with a I-am-a-frontend-developer-and-I-never-use-a-framework-bullshit.css, I quickly miss stuff that I need.

In this case I missed a grid. I wanted to copy paste something quick, but I noticed that I really don't know anything about flexbox. This is a great opportunity to find out.

I need a dropin minimal css framework just to do a quick fix in existing projects.

What I mostly need from a dropin css:

- layout (I have no idea why you would create a css framework without a layout, but there you have one of the reasons I needed this)
- positioning (flexbox)
- image util

But why stop there ..

- buttons
- typography
- basic reset (normalize is a bit much)

and whatever I in the future add
