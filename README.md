# monk-style

I need a dropin minimal css framework just to do a quick fix in existing projects.

What I mostly need from a dropin css:

- layout (I have no idea why you would create a css framework without a layout, but there you have one of the reasons I needed this)
- positioning (flexbox)
- image util

But why stop there ..

- buttons
- typography
- basic reset (normalize is a bit much)

and whatever I in the future add
